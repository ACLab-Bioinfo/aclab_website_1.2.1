Held from April 5th to 10th at the San Diego Convention Center, this gathering is a cornerstone event organized by the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR).</p>

<p>The AACR continues its relentless pursuit to prevent and cure all cancers. As the world’s first and largest cancer research organization, it boasts a membership exceeding 54,000 professionals from more than 130 countries. These members are at the vanguard in the global battle against cancer.</p>

<p>During the meeting, our team had the opportunity to present a poster showcasing our latest research findings. This was not only a platform for us to disseminate our work but also a fertile ground for sharing ideas and engaging in thought-provoking discussions with researchers from around the world.</p>

<p><strong>CU Medicine uncovers the keys for liver cancer adaptation to immunotherapy</strong></p>

<p>Liver cancer remains one of the most common cancers in the world. Recent research from CUHK’s Faculty of Medicine has discovered how liver cancer cells adapt to immunotherapy, the most advanced therapy for cancer patients. The team empowered immunotherapy by counteracting the resistance mechanisms of cancer cells and confirmed their clinical potential in liver cancer animal models. Research results have been published in the leading international journal Gut. The team is also going to commence a new Phase II clinical trial of combination immunotherapy, aiming to translate the discovery into patient benefits.</p>

The JRS is funding 10 projects at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), while the CRS is funding two. Among the eight University Grants Committee (UGC)-funded universities, CUHK is the leader in the number of projects funded by the JRS and the total number funded by both schemes.</p>

<p>The NSFC/RGC JRS and CRS support research proposals jointly submitted by mainland and Hong Kong researchers. The JRS aims to promote collaboration between researchers and research teams in Hong Kong and the mainland by complementing the existing strengths of both sides, while the CRS aims to support larger-scale collaborative research across disciplines and universities in the mainland and Hong Kong, with a view to enhancing the research output and impact of both.</p>

<p>CUHK’s Pro-Vice-Chancellor Professor Sham Mai-har said, “The NSFC/RGC Schemes serve as catalysts that link researchers and research teams from Hong Kong and mainland China together to unlock new frontiers of knowledge. It brings me great joy to witness that CUHK researchers are engaged in high-calibre collaborative projects with their mainland counterparts. With the steadfast support of the NSFC and RGC, I envisage a future when researchers from both regions complement their individual strengths to orchestrate a symphony of innovation that yields transformative research outcomes.”</p>
